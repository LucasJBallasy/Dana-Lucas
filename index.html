          <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
            On the first day of Dana’s Spring semester at Tyler School of Art, an unfamiliar face walked into class. He was well-dressed and walked with confidence. Needless to say, he caught Dana’s eye instantly. It turns out he was the class’s teaching assistant, Lucas. Little did she know, he also had his eye on her. With the last week of classes coming to a close, Luke invited her to see his show at Hard Rock Cafe. Later that night, he got her number.
            <br><br>
            Soon, they went on their first date: a bike ride to Rittenhouse square for a Wawa picnic. Romantic? College budget friendly? Check and check. Next, Luke decided to try a more unique date with a trip to the Edgar Allan Poe museum. He thought: “If she’s into this, she’s a keeper.” She totally was.
            <br><br>
            After only a couple weeks of hanging out, Dana and Luke sadly had to part ways. Dana traveled to Rome to study abroad and Lucas got on a plane to Los Angeles for a summer internship. They began to write each other letters and send postcards.
            </p>

          <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
            After a summer apart, Luke couldn’t wait to pop the question (no, not that one yet). On a hot, sticky August morning in Philadelphia, Luke asked Dana to be his girlfriend.
            <br><br>
            The rest was history.

          <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
            A year later, after Luke’s graduation, he made the move to New York City to start his career while Dana finished her Senior year. They kept Bolt Bus in business by going back and forth on weekends. Despite the late Sunday night commutes, they made their relationship work.
            </p>
            <img class="mc__1-col-image fade-in" src="images/philly-to-ny-inline.jpg" alt="mc__1-col-image" />
          <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
            Once Dana finished her degree, she too came to the big city to begin her career (yes, Luke was the added bonus). She moved to Jersey City Heights, a few blocks away from Luke. Now with only a short walk between them instead of a two hour bus ride, their relationship grew stronger. They began doing freelance projects together, refurbishing old furniture, cooking dinner together, and in time, dreamed of what living under the same roof would be like.
            <br><br>
            One long but <i>exciting</i> apartment search later, they finally found the perfect place to call home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. A small apartment, as to be expected, but cozy. In no time, they made it theirs.

          <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
            Once Brooklyn became home, they started itching to explore other places, eventually filling their home with artifacts from all of their adventures: Mexico, Boston, Thailand, Barcelona, and Vermont.

        <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
          Six years and one month since that August morning in Philly, Luke popped another question (yep, the big one!). This time on his knee on an overcast day at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Special thanks to Eric, a friend of the couple, for beautifully capturing the moment. Dana was truly surprised. She said yes and even though she never thought she would cry, she couldn’t help herself.
          <br><br>
          On their walk home, Luke told Dana about the months leading up to that moment: secretly designing the engagement ring with a former Tyler alumni, telling her parents at her Dad’s birthday and making them keep it a secret the whole time, and nervously shipping a diamond across the country.
          <br><br>
          They went to dinner to celebrate and… another surprise! Luke invited Dana’s parents, his parents, brother, and sister-in-law to celebrate the day.

        <p class="mc__paragraph fade-in">
          The night ended surrounded by friends at a local bar. It was perfect and exciting but the best part of the story was <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rek9pp412awk93p/Mom-Mom_Ballasy_Wedding.m4a?dl=0 Mom-Mom_Ballasy_Wedding.mp4" target="_blank">telling Mom-Mom</a> that they chose a date.
